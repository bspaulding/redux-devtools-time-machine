# redux-devtools-time-machine

Totally impractical, but hugely fun!

*DISCLAIMER:* I've not yet tried this on any app but the included Counter app.
Currently, this monitor renders the app for each computed state.
If you lock up your browser, or other weird stuff happens, you have been warned.

## Controls

Click the TARDIS to engage or disengage time travel.

Use the arrows to travel along your app's timeline.

Click restore to jump back to the currently viewed state.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `ctrl-T` to toggle the TARDIS

Use the arrow keys (`up/down`) to move through time.

Pressing `shift+up` or `shift+down` will jump to the first/last states.

Press `meta-Enter` (`cmd-Enter` on a Mac) to restore the currently viewed state.
